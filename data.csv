musc-1003,musc,1003,Music and American Democracy,3 Credit Hours.,"Music often functions to unite a people or a society. Given that the American people and society change with each passing generation and given that their guaranteed liberties seldom unite them in a wholly cohesive chorus, the ways music has been used to reinforce ideals, advance causes, shape social norms and satisfy diverse constituencies offers a rich story. For the most part, American government has played a slight role in the unfolding of American music, although there have been fascinating exceptions to this rule. A situation of minimal government policy allows for the marketplace of ideas to determine what is composed, performed, taught and cherished. Within this marketplace, fissures have frequently emerged dividing advocates of one or another approach allowing for vigorous debates.
